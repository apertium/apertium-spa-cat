Spanish and Catalan

                            apertium-spa-cat
===============================================================================

This is an Apertium language pair for translating between Spanish and
Catalan. Currently supported is translation from both Catalan and Valencian variants
to Spanish. What you can use this language package for:

For information on the latter two points, see subheading "For more
information" below

Requirements
===============================================================================

You will need the following software installed:

* lttoolbox (>= 3.3.0)
* apertium (>= 3.3.0)
* apertium-spa
* apertium-cat

If this does not make any sense, we recommend you look at: www.apertium.org

**************Spanish--Catalan with economy vocabulary**********************

To compile using the economy vocabulary (entries with "eco" tag in the dictionaries), type:
cp Makefile.am.eco Makefile.am
./autogen.sh
make 
sudo make install

You can use ./autogen.sh instead of ./configure you're compiling from
SVN. If you installed any prerequisite language packages using a --prefix
to ./configure, make sure to give the same --prefix to ./configure here.

If you had the standard linguistic data already installed, or if some error occurs in compilation, you should type:

cp Makefile.am.eco Makefile.am
sudo make distclean
./autogen.sh
make 
sudo make install

After compiling, to use Apertium with the economy vocabulary, use the same commands presented above (apertium es-ca ; apertium ca-es)


**************TAGGER *****************************

To use this language-pair package with apertium YOU DO NOT NEED TO
RETRAIN THE TAGGER. Probabilities and auxiliary data are provided for
both the cat-spa and the spa-cat translation directions which should be
acceptable for most applications, and should work even if you change
the dictionaries in a reasonably way.

If for some reason you need to retrain the tagger (for example, you
have made really extensive changes to the dictionaries such as
creating new lexical categories), please see the documentation
on our Wiki:
