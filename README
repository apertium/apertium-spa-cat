**************Spanish--Catalan******************

You need apertium-3.0 and lttoolbox-3.0 to use this translator.  To compile
the linguistic data simply do:

./configure
make
make install

inside of this directory.

To use the translator, use the commands:

apertium es-ca  (to translate from Spanish to Catalan)
apertium ca-es  (to translate from Catalan to Spanish)

Type the suitable command in the terminal, press Enter, type the text and press Ctrl+D to get the translation.

**************Spanish--Catalan with economy vocabulary**********************

To compile using the economy vocabulary (entries with "eco" tag in the dictionaries), type:
cp Makefile.am.eco Makefile.am
./autogen.sh
make 
sudo make install

If you had the standard linguistic data already installed, or if some error occurs in compilation, you should type:

cp Makefile.am.eco Makefile.am
sudo make distclean
./autogen.sh
make 
sudo make install

After compiling, to use Apertium with the economy vocabulary, use the same commands presented above (apertium es-ca ; apertium ca-es)


**************TAGGER *****************************

To use this language-pair package with apertium YOU DO NOT NEED TO
RETRAIN THE TAGGER. Probabilities and auxiliary data are provided for
both the ca-es and the es-ca translation directions which should be
acceptable for most applications, and should work even if you change
the dictionaries in a reasonably way.

If for some reason you need to retrain the tagger (for example, you
have made really extensive changes to the dictionaries such as
creating new lexical categories), please see the documentation
on our Wiki:
